** Blog and BlogNetworkEntity should not be the same each other every time. We have to use a mapper for mapping the API level to project
level.

        (API Level)                    (Project level)
        BlogNetworkEntity -> Mapper -> Blog

** It is good practice for separating persistence models and network models. Because they are not always the same. User mapper or converting
them each other.
